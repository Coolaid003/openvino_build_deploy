```bash
npm init -y
npm install
```

Later you can turn off streaming by clicking _Stop_ button.


### Turn on the inference

To turn on blurring you have to turn on inference using the _Inference_ switch. Below it, you can notice a panel, where you can choose the inference device (e.g. AUTO, GPU, CPU, NPU).

You can change the inference device or video source, and turn on and off inference, and streaming anytime.
